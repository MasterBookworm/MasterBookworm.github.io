     <h1>A Plant's Life</h1>

     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Sunflowers are an amazingly versatile crop with a fascinating history. They have been used as a crop in the Midwest dating back a thousand years ago. The earliest human use of sunflowers is believed to have been four thousand or more years ago. Remarkably, out of all the major field crops grown in the Midwest today, sunflowers are the only one native to the United States.</p>

     <h2>Background</h2>
     <p>When Europeans first came to the U.S., they viewed sunflower as a pretty ornamental, not really considering it as a food crop, despite its history of food use by Native Americans. While it was being largely ignored in the U.S., it eventually became developed as a modern food crop almost as a fluke of history. In Russia, where most oily foods were banned on Lent by the Orthodox Church in the 1800s, sunflower was one of the only options not on the banned list, and thus became of interest to the Russian people as an oilseed. Russian agriculturalists worked throughout the 1800s to develop the crop, greatly increasing its oil content and making it more suited to modern agriculture. Only after the Russians had made great progress with sunflower breeding and development did it finally re-emerge as a crop in the U.S. The first known commercial processing of sunflowers in the U.S. was actually in Missouri in 1926. Sunflower in the U.S. took off as a crop in the 1970s due to demand for the oil from Europe. In recent decades, sunflower acreage in the U.S. has varied but averaged roughly two million acres per year.</p>

     <h2 id="seed">Seed</h2>

     <p>The sunflower seed is the fruit of the sunflower. There are three types of commonly used sunflower seeds: linoleic (most common), high oleic, and sunflower oil seeds. Sunflower seeds are usually classified by the pattern on their husks. If the husk is solid black, the seeds are called black oil sunflower seeds. The crops may be referred to as oilseed sunflower crops. These seeds are usually pressed to extract their oil. Striped sunflower seeds are primarily eaten as a snack food; as a result, they may be called confectionery sunflower seeds. The term "sunflower seed" is actually incorrect when applied to the seed in its hull. When dehulled, the edible remainder is called the sunflower kernel or heart.</p>

     <p>The versatility of sunflowers is reflected in the fact that it can grow on a wide range of soils in many latitudes and are tolerant of dry conditions. Indeed, tens of millions of acres of sunflowers are grown worldwide. In the U.S., the leading state for sunflower acreage is North Dakota, followed by South Dakota. In Missouri, sunflower has a wide range of planting dates, any time from early April to July. It is also versatile in the many different uses for the seeds, flowers, and plant, as described below. Many people notice wild sunflowers blooming along Missouri roadsides in late summer. While members of the same plant genus, those roadside plants are different species, generally wild perennials, as opposed to the domesticated annual sunflower crop (Helianthus annuus). A myth persists that planting a field of commercial sunflowers can lead to the wild sunflowers seen along roads or occasionally popping up as weeds in no-till fields. That is not the case at all! It would be like a cocker spaniel giving birth to a wolf...the genetics just do not work that way. Farmers who have grown sunflowers in the region feel they pose no threat as a weed, particularly since most seeds that fall to the ground are quickly devoured by birds or other wildlife.  As a beautiful, vigorous native crop, sunflowers help pollinators, beneficial insects, song birds, and other wildlife, and improve soil with a deep taproot. It is a great rotation crop and has the potential to add income for specialty markets (see more on that below). A field of sunflowers in bloom can lift up the human spirit, which is why you find everything from calendars to paintings to hats and clothing depicting the brilliant golden flowers. Sunflowers are certainly worthy of consideration for any farm or garden, even if planted in just a small area to brighten up a summer day. When growing sunflowers for commercial use, a careful plan for marketing is in order.</p>

     <h2 id="full-grown">Full-Grown Plant</h2>

     <p>The common sunflower (H. annuus) is an annual herb with a rough hairy stem and coarsely toothed, rough leaves arranged in spirals. The attractive heads of flowers are 7.5 to 15 cm wide in wild specimens and often 30 cm or more in cultivated types. The disk flowers are brown, yellow, or purple, while the petallike ray flowers are yellow. The fruit is a single-seeded achene. Oilseed varieties typically have small black achenes, while those grown for direct seed consumption, known as confection varieties, have larger black-and-white achenes that readily separate from the seed within. The common sunflower is valuable from an economic as well as from an ornamental point of view. The leaves are used as fodder, the flowers yield a yellow dye, and the seeds contain oil and are used for food. The sweet yellow oil obtained by compression of the seeds is considered equal to olive or almond oil for table use. Sunflower oil cake is used for stock and poultry feeding. The oil is also used in soap and paints and as a lubricant. The seeds may be eaten dried, roasted, or ground into nut butter and are common in birdseed mixes.</p>
